                <p class="spaced-out-par">Our idea addressed the problem of bad hygiene and unnecessary labor associated with many waiter positions in restaurants. The tedious work being done in restaurants, especially cleaning tables, were very inefficient, took up unnecessary
                    labor, and was a cost to the hygiene of the customers. In addition to the unnecessary labor that was being put into use in these restaurant, we found that their work was not helping at all. Bacteria and other germs were still present
                    on many restaurant tables after work being done by waiters, and many were not satisfied. From our survey addressing current restaurant hygiene, over 95 percent of students had a been to a restaurant where the table hygiene and cleanliness
                    was not up to their satisfaction. Additionally, the same survey reported that over two-thirds of the students we surveyed preferred automated cleaning over current practices as the standard method of cleaning in the food industry.
                    Ultimately, unnecessary manual labor was being implemented where simple automation would have been much more efficient and cost effective. Current solutions include handheld devices, which reduce the unnecessary labor, but do not eliminate
                    it completely. Our product Tidy Table targets both the consumers of this industry, as well as the business owners. The product provides the consumers of the industry with satisfying conditions on restaurant tables, along with faster
                    restaurant service because of its efficiency. The product also drastically reduces costs the businesses incur to employ workers with the extra task of cleaning tables, and pushes the industry one step closer to full automation, where
                    restaurants will function at maximum capacity, efficiency, as well as quality. </p>
